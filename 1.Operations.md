# Operations

Qubits are represented as vectors. The simplest operation that can be done on qubits is the swap operations that simply
swaps the first qbit with the second:

$$
S_{10} \vert xy \rangle = \vert yx \langle
$$

## CNOT

It's a simple 2 qbit gate that changes the value of a target qbit iff the control qbit (that remains unchanged) is 1:

| control | target |      |   |   |
|---------|--------|------|---|---|
| 0       | 0      |      | 0 | 0 |
| 0       | 1      | CNOT | 0 | 1 |
| 1       | 0      |      | 1 | 1 |
| 1       | 1      |      | 1 | 0 |

Subscript numbers specify which qbit is the control and which one is the target.
With the swap is not necessary to specify it, i.e. $S_{10} = S_{01}$.

$$
C_01 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

Let's check this is unitary TODO

## AND

As an exercise write the AND gate (which is not reversible):

| control | target |     |   |   |
|---------|--------|-----|---|---|
| 0       | 0      |     | 0 | 0 |
| 0       | 1      | AND | 0 | 0 |
| 1       | 0      |     | 0 | 0 |
| 1       | 1      |     | 0 | 1 |

How to write the transformation matrix: rows represents inputs and columns represents output, what you do is write a 1
if (input) goes to (output).

Check that AND is not unitary, therefore not reversible:

## Number operator

It's not a gate! It's an operator that applied to the gate returns the scalar number of ones in the gate.

$$
\bold n = x \vert x \rangle, x = 0, 1
$$

of course $\bold 

## Z gate

A gate that has no counterpart in classical computation is the Z gate.

$$
\bold Z = \tilde {\bold n} - \bold n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & -1\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

This adds a **phase** to the state 1 alone. It anticommutes with the NOT operator, which is called the X gate.
That means $ZX = -XZ$

Applied returns the complex conjugate. Particular cases:

$$
Z \vert0\rangle = \vert0\rangle, Z \vert1\rangle = -\vert1\rangle
$$

The Z and the X gates are so-called Pauli gates.

## Y gate

It's the first gate with complex coefficient in its matrix. In this case we have pure imaginary:

$$
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\\i & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

Applied to a $\vert0\rangle$ becomes:

$$
\sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ i \end{pmatrix} = i \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

The X, Y, Z gates have a unitary square, and they all anticommute in pairs. That means $\sigma_x \sigma_y = - \sigma_x \sigma_y$ and so on...

## Hadamard gate

Also no correspondence in classical computation: fundamental role in quantum computation. It's expressed as combination
of Pauli gates:

$$
H = {1 \over \sqrt2}(X + Z) = {1 \over \sqrt2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\1 & -1\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

When applied to a $\vert0\rangle$ makes it become: ${1 \over \sqrt2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

but we can rewrite it as:

$$
{1 \over \sqrt2} [\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}]
= {1 \over \sqrt2}[\vert0\rangle + \vert1\rangle]
$$

this is the meaning of _qubits can be in a superposition of states_. This is a superposition of the two states and can
be seen clearly. That's also the so-called paradox of Schr√∂dinger's cat.

That's why we use vectors to represent this superpositions, that are **linear combinations** of base states.

Applied to $\vert1\rangle$, the Hadamard operator yields ${1 \over \sqrt2}[\vert0\rangle - \vert1\rangle]$.

Applying Hadamard two times on the state 1 yields...

$$
HH \vert1\rangle = {1 \over 2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \vert1\rangle
$$

Some properties useful to demonstrate some algorithms are:

$$
HXH = Z, HZH = X \\
H^2 = 1
$$

H is also able to exchange the control and target qubits of a CNOT gate:

$$
C_{ct} = (H_tH_c)C_{tc}(H_tH_c)
$$

## Properties of states

States are always **normalized**, so a given state $\vert\psi\rangle$ always has a 2-norm of 1.

$$
| \vert\psi\rangle |^2 = \langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle = [ \alpha_0^* \langle 0 \vert + \alpha_1^* \langle 1 \vert ] [ \alpha_0 \vert 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 \vert 1 \rangle ]
= \alpha_0^* \alpha_0 + \alpha_1^* \alpha_1 = |\alpha_0|^2 + |\alpha_1|^2
$$

For a two-qubits state remains the sum of squares.

Circuit representation: useful for representing the processing of quantum information. The flux is left to right contrary
to algebraic notation.
