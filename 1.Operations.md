# Operations

Qubits are represented as vectors. The simplest operation that can be done on qubits is the swap operations that simply
swaps the first qbit with the second:

$$
S_{10} \vert xy \rangle = \vert yx \rangle
$$

## CNOT

It's a simple 2 qbit gate that changes the value of a target qbit iff the control qbit (that remains unchanged) is 1:

| control | target |      |   |   |
|---------|--------|------|---|---|
| 0       | 0      |      | 0 | 0 |
| 0       | 1      | CNOT | 0 | 1 |
| 1       | 0      |      | 1 | 1 |
| 1       | 1      |      | 1 | 0 |

Subscript numbers specify which qbit is the control and which one is the target.
With the swap is not necessary to specify it, i.e. $S_{10} = S_{01}$.

$$
C_{01} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

### Proof: the CNOT gate is unitary

C_{01} is a complex square matrix. Its conjugate transposed $C_{01}^\dagger = C_{01}$ since C is simmetric and with
real elements only.

Therefore since $C^* = C$, then $C^{*T} = C^T = C$.

## AND

As an exercise write the AND gate (which is not reversible):

| control | target |     |   |   |
|---------|--------|-----|---|---|
| 0       | 0      |     | 0 | 0 |
| 0       | 1      | AND | 0 | 0 |
| 1       | 0      |     | 0 | 0 |
| 1       | 1      |     | 0 | 1 |

How to write the transformation matrix: rows represents inputs and columns represents output, what you do is write a 1
if (input) goes to (output).

Check that AND is not unitary, therefore not reversible. The complex square matrix for the AND gate is:

$$
C_{01} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

this matrix is not symmetrical therefore it cannot be unitary. The AND gate is not reversible.

## Number operator

It's not a gate! It's an operator that applied to the gate returns the scalar number of ones in the gate.

$$
\bold n = x \vert x \rangle, x = 0, 1
$$

of course $\bold 

## Z gate

A gate that has no counterpart in classical computation is the Z gate.

$$
\bold Z = \tilde {\bold n} - \bold n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & -1\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

This adds a **phase** to the state 1 alone. It anticommutes with the NOT operator, which is called the X gate.
That means $ZX = -XZ$

Applied returns the complex conjugate. Particular cases:

$$
Z \vert0\rangle = \vert0\rangle, Z \vert1\rangle = -\vert1\rangle
$$

The Z and the X gates are so-called Pauli gates.

## Y gate

It's the first gate with complex coefficient in its matrix. In this case we have pure imaginary:

$$
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\\i & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

Applied to a $\vert0\rangle$ becomes:

$$
\sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ i \end{pmatrix} = i \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

The X, Y, Z gates have a unitary square, and they all anticommute in pairs. That means $\sigma_x \sigma_y = - \sigma_x \sigma_y$ and so on...

## Hadamard gate

Also no correspondence in classical computation: fundamental role in quantum computation. It's expressed as combination
of Pauli gates:

$$
H = {1 \over \sqrt2}(X + Z) = {1 \over \sqrt2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\1 & -1\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

When applied to a $\vert0\rangle$ makes it become: ${1 \over \sqrt2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

but we can rewrite it as:

$$
{1 \over \sqrt2} [\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}]
= {1 \over \sqrt2}[\vert0\rangle + \vert1\rangle]
$$

this is the meaning of _qubits can be in a superposition of states_. This is a superposition of the two states and can
be seen clearly. That's also the so-called paradox of SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

That's why we use vectors to represent this superpositions, that are **linear combinations** of base states.

Applied to $\vert1\rangle$, the Hadamard operator yields ${1 \over \sqrt2}[\vert0\rangle - \vert1\rangle]$.

Applying Hadamard two times on the state 1 yields...

$$
HH \vert1\rangle = {1 \over 2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \vert1\rangle
$$

Some properties useful to demonstrate some algorithms are:

$$
HXH = Z, HZH = X \\
H^2 = 1
$$

H is also able to exchange the control and target qubits of a CNOT gate:

$$
C_{ct} = (H_tH_c)C_{tc}(H_tH_c)
$$

## Properties of states

States are always **normalized**, so a given state $\vert\psi\rangle$ always has a 2-norm of 1.

$$
| \vert\psi\rangle |^2 = \langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle = [ \alpha_0^* \langle 0 \vert + \alpha_1^* \langle 1 \vert ] [ \alpha_0 \vert 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 \vert 1 \rangle ]
= \alpha_0^* \alpha_0 + \alpha_1^* \alpha_1 = |\alpha_0|^2 + |\alpha_1|^2
$$

For a two-qubits state remains the sum of squares.

Circuit representation: useful for representing the processing of quantum information. The flux is left to right contrary
to algebraic notation.

## Measurement "gate"

There's a catch: when you want to measure the state of a qubit, you only get either 0 or 1. The probability of getting
0 or 1 is the square modulus of the coefficients.

Let's say I have a linear superposition

$$
a \vert 0 \rangle + b \vert 1 \rangle
$$

Will I get 0 or 1? That's the only real random process, infact given enough precision and a set of initial condiitons
you can determine every system evolution. That's not true for quantum mechanics.

$$
p_0 = |a|^2 \\
p_1 = |b|^2
$$

Probabilities always sums to 1.

$$
\vert \psi \rangle _n = \sum_{0 \le x \lt 2^n} \alpha_x \vert x \rangle _n \\
p(x) = |\alpha_x|^2
$$

The measurement of a quantum state changes the state itself: it's not possible to not alter the state as it would (not)
occur in classical physics.

This function reduct or collapse the quantum state to a value.

The Born rule states that you cannot measure the same qubit multiple times to get a hold of the probability of each
state: the state collapses and will therefore yield the same result.

> The probabilist nature of quantum mechanics is inborn and does not come from our ignorance of the quantum state.

Does this seems useless in spite the fact the result is random?

A trivial generalization of Born's rule holds when an observer measure a whole system of n qubits in an m qubits register.
(m > n)

## Phase

Given a generic linear superposition of states:

$$
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha_a \vert a \rangle + \alpha_b \vert b \rangle + \alpha_c \vert c \rangle 
$$

and coefficients (that are complex) squares must sum to 1.

The complex coefficient $\alpha_a$ can also be represented with the polar form $r_a e^{i \gamma_a}$.

$$
\vert \psi \rangle = r_a e^{i \gamma_a} \vert a \rangle + r_b e^{i \gamma_b} \vert b \rangle + r_c e^{i \gamma_c} \vert c \rangle \\
= r_a [e^{i \gamma_a} \vert a \rangle + r_b e^{i (\gamma_b - \gamma_a)} \vert b \rangle + r_c e^{i (\gamma_c - \gamma_a)} \vert c \rangle]
$$

Let $\vert \psi' \rangle$ be the part inside of the square brackets. You now have the same quantum state with a common
phase (which is $e^{i \gamma_a}$) that can be neglected.

That's true for the global phase only, the relative phase between components is important (the gammas differences at exponent).

The quantum state for $H \vert 1 \rangle$ is the same as ${1 \over \sqrt2}(- \vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$.

Even though a relative phase is not observable, it's important.

### Phase Shift Gate

The phase shift ports rotates the qubits of an angle, therefore varying its global phase:

$$
R_\phi = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & e^{i \phi}\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

Two qubits can be in a linear superposition, in general their state cannot be separated. If not written independent, it's said they're **entangled**.

This does not happen in classic physics and happens regardless of any interaction between the two.
The collapse of the wave function is instanteneous and seems to contradict relativity: no information can travel faster
than light.

It's not possible to actively transfer information, but you know that for each couple of entangled qubits you will find
the same information on both qubits.
That's the base for quantum algorithms.

$$
\vert 00 \rangle + \vert 01 \rangle + \vert 11 \rangle \\
\vert 0 \rangle (\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle) + \vert 1 \rangle \vert 1 \rangle
$$

the state of the first qubit determines the state of the second (they're entangled). Measuring the rightmost qubit first
does not change the outcome (in probability) since measure the leftmost first does not change the overall probability.
