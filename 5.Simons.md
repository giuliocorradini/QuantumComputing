# Simon's problem

Let's consider a function of n classical bits with a periodicity a, i.e. $f(x \oplus a) = f(x)$ where we want to
recover the period a.

This algorithm has a probabilistic nature (BPP): in classical computing you have to compute the function f until you
find the same output.

The upper bound grows exponentially with n, so in order to have a reasonable probability of finding a is: $2^{n \over 2}$.

To start, prepare a n qubit state of uniformly weighted superpositions. If we apply $U_f$ we get:

By applying $U_f$ to the input, you get the state

$$
{1 \over 2^{N \over 2}} \sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} \vert x \rangle \vert f(x) \rangle
$$

So we have the input and output register nearby. Now measure a qubit of the output register. You will have two states
(since each individual qubit can collapse to two values, it's a bit!).

For example the output we get with 4 qubits is:

$$
\vert 0000 \rangle \vert f(0000) \rangle + \dots + \vert 0111 \rangle \vert f(0111) \rangle + \dots
$$

and let's say that by measuring the second qubit, we are retrieving the value for two values of f (that maps to the same
value) i.e. I would measure the state $(\vert 0000 \rangle + \vert 0111 \rangle) \vert f(0000) \rangle$.

The information is hidden in the linear combination of the input (and get a from that), but we can apply N hadamards on
the state of input and output register.
Now apply the equation from the B-V problem to get:

$$
{1 \over 2^{(n+1) \over 2}} \sum_{y=0}^{2^n - 1} ((-1)^{x_0 y} + (-1)^{(x_0 \oplus a) y}) \vert y \rangle
$$

The coefficient is 0 if $a \cdot y = 1$ because the power of the second (-1) is always zero. If $a \cdot y$ is 0,
then the coefficient becomes $2(-1)^{x_0 \cdot y}$.

The final state becomes:

$$
{1 \over {2^{(n-1) \over 2}}} \sum_{a \cdot y =0} (-1)^{x_0 \cdot y} \vert y \rangle
$$

and if we measure the input register we get a state for which $a \cdot y = 0$. Let's say we have y=001101,
where y=0 I don't have any information on a, but where y=1 I get information on a.
Where do I get it? On the input register where I have ay!

This allows to learn a with high probability (n+20 invocations of $U_f$).
