# Adders

Multi-qubit gates that are easy to implement are the half and full adders.

The idea is to use CNOT on output registers initialized to 0 and CCNOT to compute
the second digit.

To create an entangled state of two qubits, you start with  $\vert 00 \rangle$ then Hadamard q1, which is equal
to $H \vert 0 \rangle \vert 0 \rangle$, ultimately it becomes $\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)} (\vert 01 \angle + \vert 00 \rangle)$
which is not entangled.

Let's try by applying Hadamard on qubit 0. $H_0 \vert 00 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt(2)} \vert 0 \rangle (\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1 \rangle)$.
Now apply a CNOT with q0 as control, and you will get either $\vert 00 \rangle$ if q0 = 0, else $\vert 11 \rangle$ if the first qubit
measures 1.
