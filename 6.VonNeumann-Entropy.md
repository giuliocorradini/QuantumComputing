# Von Neumann entanglement entropy

In general a quantum state cannot be written as composition of its substate, as opposed to classical bit states,
if you can do so the system is _separable_.

$$
\vert \psi \rangle _{n+m} = \vert \overline \psi \rangle _n \cdot \vert \overline \psi \rangle _m
$$

this is not the case except a very small subset of cases, called separable (n, m) qubits.

By the generalized Born rule you must include all possibilities. So the state is decomposed in a sum, with probabilities
$a_{xy}$ to find each specific measure with some probability.

The measure on entanglement is still an open problem, we're still trying to find good measures of entanglement.

The states are entangled if one depends on the state of the other.

## Density

The density matrix or operator $\rho$ operates on a pure state. Recall that a ket $\vert \psi \rangle$ can be represented
as a column and a bra $\langle \psi \vert$ is represented by a row vector.

The density $\rho$ of a state $\vert \psi \rangle$ is the ket-bra product: $\rho = \vert \psi \rangle \langle \psi \vert$.

### Normalization

The normalization of a state is $\langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle$, so row by column product.

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (\langle 00 \vert + \langle 10 \vert) \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (\vert 00 \rangle + \vert 10 \rangle) \\
= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (1 0 1 0) \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(1010)^T = \frac{1}{2}2 = 1
$$

The result is a number.

With the density operator we obtain a matrix. This is not a quantum gate and it's not a transformation matrix. It's just
another way to represent the quantum state.

The ket notation is useful for pure states only, if you want to represent non-pure states you have to resort to the
density matrix. We need this matrix to compute the formula to quantify the entanglement.

> A quantum state can be partially entangled.

The normalization constant is 1 over the sqrt of the sum of the squares of coefficients.

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt 5} (2 \vert 00 \rangle + \vert 11 \rangle) \ne \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (\vert 00 \rangle + \vert 11 \rangle)
$$

The probability of having 00 and 11 is different, so the amount of entanglement is different.

## General form

The density matrix in its general form is:

We compute the partial trace operation: for each subsystem matrix we throw away the non-diagonal elements and we compute
the trace (sum the diagonal elements neglecting the non-diagonal). The same goes for each square submatrix.

Each trace becomes an element of the reduced matrix.
