# Introduction

Scaling down the size of processors begin to expose the quantum behavior of reality. You cannot descrive behaviors
of physics using Newton's and classic physics. Physical models are no longer suitable to describe these effects.

Typically information is stored in a physical medium and manipulated by physical processes. In classical electronics
information is stored in bits, that can either have a 0 state or a 1 state.

In the seventies physicists realised that information is always physical: you cannot have information if you do not
have a physical system that holds it. Thinking itself relies on some sort of storage: the electrons running in
your brain.

Since any physical system is fully described by quantum physics at the end of the day, although classical physics
is a good macro approximation, then describing information can also rely upon by quantum.

Classic computers are based on the classic physics, which although working is an incomplete framework.

The periodic table was introduced by just investigating the properties of elements. A success of quantum physics
is understanding the periodic table.

Quantum physics can be exploited for computer science but the physical system must be entirely under control and
isolated to avoid decoherence. By exposing the quantum nature of information, computation can be vastly more efficient.
The most important difficulty is related to the realisation of a quantum computer itself, not to the maths behind it.

Transistor-based computing is small, can be operated at relatively high temperatures and can withstand vibrations,
but quantum computers (at the actual state of the art) must run in very monitored environments. Those need to be
cooled down to extremely low temperatures, otherwise the phenomenon of decoherence arises and you lose the quantum
effect.

It was proven 30-35 years ago, by Peter Shor, that quantum computation is vastly more efficient than the actual computing
models. In 2019 Google proved that such computation is possible, and public cloud services for quantum computation
is available.

## Prerequisites

Complex numbers, exponential

## Notations

When information is stored in a quantum system it's represented as a superposition of go-to states.

Ket notation was introduced by Dirac and encodes qubits as $\vert 0 \rangle$ and $\vert 1 \rangle$.

In order to use an easier and compact version we can concatenate the ket-bra notation of multiple qbits as such:

$$
\vert 0 \rangle, \vert 0 \rangle, \vert 1 \rangle = \vert 001 \rangle
$$

It's not always clear from the context, when using decimal notation, what's the size of the qubits vector. We can
specify it by using a subscript number.

Qubit basis states $\vert 0 \rangle$ and $\vert 1 \rangle$ are represented as two-elements vector of

$$
\vert 0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},

\vert 1 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Two qubits states can be written in a more formal way as a tensor product of their vector elements as such:

$$
00 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
$$

For example:

$$
\vert5\rangle_3 = \vert101\rangle = ... TODO
$$

## Reversible operations

In a classical computation scenario we have a set of gates that can perform any possible computation
(given that the Church-Turing conjecture proves true).

NOT is reversible, AND is not reversible. The same is true for quantum computing where those two gates represented as
follows:

$$
X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\1 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

X flips the qubit.

$$
1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & 1\\ \end{pmatrix}
$$

is the identity gate.

All gates are represented by square matrices, but those must be unically. That means that given U square matrix,
U represents a gate iff. $U^t = U^{-1}$.

In quantum computing all gates *MUST BE* reversible, and thus we don't have an and gate.

## Hermitian

Used when moving from the direct space to the dual space. The dual space is represented with the bra $\langle 0 \vert$,
its value is obtained by computing the transposed conjugation (hermitian) of the vector. So it will become a row with
the complex conjugate.

$$
| \vert 0 \rangle |^2 = \langle 0 \vert 0 \rangle =
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
= 1
$$

General states are represented as complex numbers, a generic state is:

$$
\langle \phi \vert \psi \rangle
$$

## Unitary (complex square) matrix U

Quantum gates are represented by a unitary square matrix, i.e. a matrix U that:

$$
U^\dagger U = UU^\dagger = I
$$
