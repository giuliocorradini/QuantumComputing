# No-Cloning Theorem

The no-cloning theorem states that a qubit cannot be duplicated.

## Entanglement and "spooky action at a distance"

Alice and Bob measure their qubits, that are entangled.

The probability of having both state 1 is nonzero. If they both apply Hadamard the probability is zero.

Applying H to Alice qubit gives this result: ...

This set of possibilities is inconsistent with a local classical theory.
