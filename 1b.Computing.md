# Computing

So what does computing mean?

Typically you have a function $y_m = f(x_n)$. The computation is an application of a unically transformation that will
have both an input register and an output register.

Both registers are present from the beggining to the end of your computation.

Given that $U = U^{-1}$, then U is reversible. Applying the transformation twice reverses the computation.
